  All response must be in Markdown format that is spaced out for readability.

  The following example shows how to provide a response for a code change:

  ## /src/main.py

  The \`main.py\` file contains the main entry point for the application.
  The user will be able to run the application by executing this file directly.

  ### Changes Made:

  - Added a new function to handle user input
  - Updated the main function to call the new function
