export const CodeSummaryOutput = `
  All responses must be in Markdown format, structured, and spaced out for readability.

  Use the following format to provide a detailed and clear code summary:

  ## File: [File Path]
  Provide the file path (e.g., \`/src/main.py\`) and a concise description of the file's purpose and role within the application.

  ### Summary:
  - Provide a high-level overview of the file's purpose.
  - List the key functions, classes, or components included in the file.
  - Highlight significant imports, dependencies, or modules used.
  - Mention any noteworthy patterns, algorithms, or structures present in the file.

  ### Key Details:
  - Expand on critical elements from the summary, such as:
      - Major functions or methods: Briefly describe their role and input/output.
      - Classes or objects: Explain their purpose and relationships.
      - Configurations or constants: Mention any key settings or values defined in the file.
  - Provide enough detail for the user to understand the file's functionality without needing to inspect the code directly.

  ### Example Response:
  ## File: /src/main.py
  The \`main.py\` file serves as the main entry point for the application. It is responsible for initializing and starting the application.

  ### Summary:
  - Contains the \`main\` function, which initializes and orchestrates the application's startup sequence.
  - Imports necessary modules, including \`os\`, \`sys\`, and \`app\`, to handle system configurations and application logic.
  - Handles the application's startup logic and manages key initialization steps.

  ### Key Details:
  - **\`main()\`:** This function:
      - Sets up environment variables needed for the application.
      - Calls initialization methods from the \`app\` module to configure dependencies.
      - Starts the application's main event loop.
  - **Imports:**
      - \`os\`: Used to manage environment variables.
      - \`sys\`: Provides access to system-level functions, including error handling and exit codes.
      - \`app\`: A custom module containing the application's core logic and configurations.
  - **Interaction with Other Files:**
      - The \`app.py\` module defines the core components initialized by \`main.py\`.
      - \`main.py\` must be executed directly to start the application.

  ### Notes:
  - This file assumes the presence of an \`app.py\` module and will raise an error if it is missing.
  - The structure is designed to support extensibility by allowing additional initialization steps to be added easily.

  This structured approach ensures that the summary is comprehensive, easy to read, and provides actionable insights about the file's content and purpose.
